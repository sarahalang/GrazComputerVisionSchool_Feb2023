# GrazComputerVisionSchool_Feb2023
Materials for the Computer Vision School held in Graz in February 2023. The project was funded by CLARIAH. 

Here are some slides and links to our Github repositories.
- Suzana's GitHub: https://github.com/suzanaSagadin/ComputerVisionWinterschool_2023
- Anguelos' Github: https://github.com/anguelos/graz_cv_ws2023/tree/main/hackathon 
- Germaine's Github: https://github.com/GGoetzelmann/cv_ws_2023 

In the future, we will film videos and share all the code/notebooks and slides via DARIAH-Campus.
Until then, you can look at the work in progress here.
